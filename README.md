# Landmine Chess Frontend ♟️💣

A real-time online chess variant where strategy meets surprise through hidden bombs on the board. Click [here](https://github.com/azhang4216/minesweeper-chess-backend) for the backend repo.

## 🎮 Game Description

Landmine Chess follows standard chess rules with an explosive twist. Before the game begins, each player secretly places three bombs on their half of the board:
- White places bombs within ranks 3 and 4
- Black places bombs within ranks 5 and 6

If any piece (friend or foe) lands on a square containing a bomb, the bomb detonates, removing both the piece and the bomb from play. Each player can see how many of their bombs remain active through a counter display.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- React.js for a responsive single-page application
- Chess UI built with react-chessboard
- Chess logic implemented with chess.js
- Redux toolkit for state management
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Socket.io client for real-time gameplay
- Axios for api requests e.g. profile login, reset password
